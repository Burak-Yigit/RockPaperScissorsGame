# RockPaperScissorsGame

This is one of the traditional games, Rock, Paper and Scissors. Most of us met this game during the childhood and yet not lost its popularity. Hereby, I wanted to create this game using Console App both to practice and to keep it alive. 
In this game, you can deposit imaginary money and bet with it. Like a typical casino game. I didn't want to create this app to only have a playin the game feature. So, I added a few more features to improve and test myself such as score table and betting feature.

#How to Play

At first, you encounter a console screen like this.
```

```
After pressing "ENTER" button, you will need to enter a number.
